## Overview

![](docs/scikick_documentation/figure1.svg)

Collections of computational notebooks often lose coherence during complex and branching investigations. Scikick is a command line utility for managing ensembles of computational notebooks developed throughout a project by providing simple commands for workflow configuration, report generation, and state management.

## Demonstrations and Documentation

[Read the introduction](https://petronislab.camh.ca/pub/scikick/stable/docs/report/out_html/introduction.html) for further details and installation requirements.

See the [tutorial](https://petronislab.camh.ca/pub/scikick/stable/docs/report/out_html/hello_world.html) for a simple example usage of Scikick.

Use the [issue board](https://github.com/matthewcarlucci/scikick/issues) to provide feedback on Scikick (feature requests, bugs, and further software-related comments).

## Quick-Start

Scikick is currently tested and working on Unix systems (i.e. macOS, Linux etc.) and can be installed with:

```
pip install scikick
```

Initializing a Scikick project with `sk init` will identify any further missing software requirements.
