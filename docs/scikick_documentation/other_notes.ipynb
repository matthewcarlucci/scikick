    "## Rstudio with Scikick projects\n",
    "\n",
    "If using Rstudio, default interactive code execution will be relative to the Rmd file location (instead of the project root). This\n",
    "can be changed to match scikick behaviour by going to `Tools > Global Options > Rmarkdown > Evaluate chunks in directory`\n",
    "and setting to \"Current\". \"Current\" should be the project root (scikick.yml directory).\n",

    "This use of hierarchy may not support some `md` conversion features of `rmarkdown::render`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use of Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of Jupyter Notebooks (i.e., `.ipynb`) in Scikick is experimental and requires that Jupyter is [installed](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",

    "  - `out_html/` - contains the resulting HTML files\n",
    "\n",
    "## External vs Internal Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "`sk add -d` is used to add all dependencies even though \"dependency\" can have two meanings. Typically everything behaves\n",
    "as one would expect. Internally dependency type is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal dependencies** - code or files the Rmd uses directly during execution  \n",
    "**External dependencies** - code that must be executed prior to the page\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikick assumes that a script dependency that has also been configured to execute (i.e. `sk add <dependent page>`) is an external dependency and must be executed before the script. Otherwise it is assumed the script must execute after changes to the dependency.\n",
