    "# The Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikick aims to improve projects with many related computational notebooks by allowing for simple expressions of dependence between the notebooks to be translated into the required execution patterns and a systematically organized report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires Scikick to handle three main areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependence definitions\n",
    "2. Notebook execution\n",
    "3. Report compilation"

    "Scikick is designed to enable loosely structured projects containing notebooks (which may not have been developed with any build system in mind) to rapidly adopt systematic execution patterns with minimal changes to analysis development practice. No special variables are defined within notebooks, therefore, notebooks can execute outside of Scikick for development work and then execute with `sk run` for validation.\n"

    "# Dependence Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects with multiple notebooks often have documentation which describes the order in which notebooks must be executed. Scikick provides a standardized minimal format for this definition in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format for a both human- and machine-readable description of notebook execution order. The basic format is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis:\n",
    "  - first_notebook.Rmd: []\n",
    "  - second_notebook.Rmd: [first_notebook.Rmd]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the keys for each notebook, specify what must execute before it (e.g. above, first_notebook.Rmd must execute before second_notebook.Rmd).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Workflow Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution in Scikick is handled by a highly generic [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow for executing computational notebooks. Snakemake is a workflow tool that is well suited to take in input files and executes a prespecified command to generate output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in simplistic snakemake pseudocode, Scikick executes `.Rmd` input notebooks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rule execute_code:\n",
    "    input: first_notebook.Rmd\n",
    "    output: report/out_md/first_notebook.md\n",
    "    R: knitr::knit(input = {input}, output = {output})\n",
    "    \n",
    "rule generate_html:\n",
    "    input: report/out_md/first_notebook.md\n",
    "    output: report/out_html/first_notebook.html\n",
    "    R: rmarkdown::render({input},{output})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Notebooks are executed to produce a markdown file.\n",
    "2. Markdown files are converted into a website (`.html` files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some supplementary rules support this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is specific to `.Rmd` files, however, similar rules exist for other file types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the rules implemented in Scikick specify dependent notebooks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre> <code>\n",
    "rule execute_code:\n",
    "    input: second_notebook.Rmd, <b> report/out_md/first_notebook.md </b>\n",
    "    output: report/out_md/second_notebook.md\n",
    "    R: ...\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `second_notebook.Rmd` requires the `first_notebook.Rmd` to have been executed (*i.e.* an up-to-date `report/out_md/first_notebook.md` output) prior to itself executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid maintainenance of project-specific Snakefiles specifying each of these rules, Scikick accepts a simple configuration file which specifies which notebooks should be executed and in which order. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will generate this configuration file using the Scikick CLI's [sk init](help.html#init)."
