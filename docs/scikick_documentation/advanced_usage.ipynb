    "- Basic dependency management (i.e. Make-like execution)  \n",
    "- Parallelization: `sk run -s -j <number of cores>` where scikick assumes each page\n",
    "uses just a single core.\n",
    "- Distribution of tasks on compute clusters (Using snakemake's `--cluster` or `--profile` arguments)    \n",

    "- Other snakemake functionality (via passed arguments)\n",

    "  - `sk add first_step.rmd -d pipeline_donefile` (where pipeline_donefile is the last file generated by the Snakefile)\n",

    "- End \n",
    "  - Add `report/out_md/last_step.md` as the input to the first job of the Snakefile.\n",
