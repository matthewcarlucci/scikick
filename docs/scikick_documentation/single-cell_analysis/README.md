### Developer Notes

The `../SCRNA_walkthrough.ipynb` runs through numerous iterations of project configuration and execution. Images are screenshots which were obtained at each state of the project manually and stored in `imgs` for reference in the notebook.

`_site.yml` is for convenience of adding to the template `scikick.yml` during the tutorial.

`notebooks/*.Rmd` source documents are moved throughout the tutorial execution to `notebooks/nestorowa`.
