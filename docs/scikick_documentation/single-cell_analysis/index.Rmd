title: Project Overview
---

This project implements analyses from the [OSCA](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) 
book on hematopoetic stem cell (HSC) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. The main purpose of the project is to illustrate how [Scikick](https://github.com/matthewcarlucci/scikick) projects are configured and typically used in a realistic setting. A [walkthrough](../../../report/out_html/SCRNA_walkthrough.html) documents how Scikick was used throughout the project to execute and manage the state of the workflow.

# Credits to the Original OSCA Work

All pages in this project (except this one) were obtained directly from the source code of the OSCA book (https://github.com/Bioconductor/OrchestratingSingleCellAnalysis/, revision d56676f9d) released under a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/us/) license and created by: Robert Amezquita, Aaron Lun, Stephanie Hicks, and Raphael Gottardo. 

Changes to the original source code are as follows:

- Notebooks were split across multiple notebooks and placed into directories to demonstrate the inter-notebook state management of Scikick.
- The first chunk of each original notebook was removed.
- Titles were added to each page.
- Headers were adjusted to the new document hierarchy.
- "Session Info" sections were removed from each page (replaced by Scikick outputs).
- The cache-based build system was replaced with standard read/write operations.
- Package loads were added to each page as needed.
- Referencing using functionality specific to the bookdown format was removed or replaced.

# Reading a Scikick Report

- Pages each correspond to a computational notebook. 
- Notebooks were configured to execute in a specific order. 
- The "Project Map" at the bottom of each page illustrates the order in which notebooks were executed.

## Project Map

The "Project Map" automatically generated by Scikick below (and at the bottom of all pages) 
can aid in navigating and visualizing the project. Each node is a page that can be clicked to navigate to it. Pages can also be navigated with the standard bootstrap navigation at the top of each page.
